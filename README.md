# thxgen.rb
Generates thank-you notes from information in Ruby.

I recommend running thxgen using rlwrap so you can use your arrow keys.

Run `chmod 755 thxgen.rb`.

You're probably wondering why you're not running it with `ruby`. Take a look at the first line of the code. That's a bash directive that tells it to run `/usr/bin/env ruby`.

Run `./thxgen.rb`, or `rlwrap thxgen.rb`.

## Getting rlwrap
```bash
brew install rlwrap
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install rlwrap
```
